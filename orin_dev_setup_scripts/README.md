# How to use Orin nano setup scripts:
 '$./00-setup-jetson-pytorch.sh'
This will install the Jetson AI Lab community kept versions of pytorch. Only way I've found with out having to jump through hoops for setup

 '$./01-setup-shakespeare-pip-dependencies.sh'
Used for installing required pip dependencies for using Shakespeare, currently working on setting up requirements.txt

 '$./02-setup-arm64-neovim.sh'
Install neovim, might be broken so will need to double check
